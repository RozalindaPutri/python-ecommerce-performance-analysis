# E-Commerce Performance Analysis using Python

📌 **Project Overview**
This project presents a Python-based data analysis of e-commerce transactions as part of the **MySkill Final Project (Python)**.
The objective is to analyze sales performance, product trends, customer behavior, and campaign effectiveness using **Python combined with SQL queries**, without applying machine learning models.
The dataset simulates e-commerce transaction data from **2021–2022** (non-real Tokopedia data) and is designed for analytical and educational purposes.

🎯 **Objectives**
* Identify top-performing products by sales quantity
* Analyze sales trends by product category across years
* Detect declining products and categories
* Identify high-potential customers with unpaid checkouts
* Evaluate weekend marketing campaign effectiveness
* Support marketing and warehouse decisions with data insights

📊 **Key Metrics Analyzed**
* Total and average sales value
* Sales quantity by product and category
* Year-over-Year (YoY) category performance
* Top products with increasing or declining sales
* Paid vs unpaid customer checkout behavior
* Weekday vs weekend sales performance

🔍 **Key Insights**
* One product dominated sales in the **Mobiles & Tablets** category during 2022.
* Most categories showed positive growth from 2021 to 2022.
* Several products in the **Others** category experienced significant sales decline.
* Unpaid checkout customers represent high potential for targeted promotions.
* Weekend campaigns did not outperform weekday sales, indicating the need for strategy evaluation.

🛠 **Tools Used**
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
* SQL (SQLite via Python)
* Google Colab
* Dataset: Simulated E-Commerce Transaction Data (MySkill)

📂 **Project Deliverables**
* Python notebooks / scripts
* SQL queries executed in Python
* Processed datasets and CSV outputs
* Final analysis report (PDF)

📝 **Notes**
* This project focuses on **Python-based data analysis with SQL integration**.
* No machine learning models were applied.
* The dataset is simulated and intended for educational and portfolio purposes.
